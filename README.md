# Employee CRUD with jQuery AJAX and Cascading Dropdowns

This is a simple **Employee CRUD** application that allows users to perform **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations on employee data. It uses **jQuery AJAX** to interact with the backend, making the application fast and responsive. Additionally, it implements **cascading dropdowns**, where the second dropdown is populated based on the selection made in the first dropdown (e.g., selecting a **State** will dynamically populate the **City** dropdown).

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for Employee records.
- **AJAX**: Interact with the backend server asynchronously using jQuery AJAX.
- **Cascading Dropdowns**: Populate the **City** dropdown based on the selected **State**.
- **User Interface**: Simple and responsive web interface to manage employee data.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - jQuery
  - Bootstrap (for UI design)
  
- **Backend**:
  - C# (ASP.NET Core)
  - Entity Framework Core (for database interactions)
  - SQL Server (or your preferred database)

- **AJAX**: 
  - jQuery for sending asynchronous HTTP requests to the server

To run this project locally:

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- .NET Core SDK
- SQL Server or any other database for backend storage

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash

   - Open **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio and run:
   
   ```bash
   Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
   Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
   ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Create the necessary database in SQL Server.
   - Run the **Entity Framework migrations** to create the database schema:
   
   ```bash
   Add-Migration InitialCreate
   Update-Database
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Press `Ctrl + F5` to run the project locally or use the terminal with the following command:

└── Startup.cs                  # ASP.NET Core configuration (Services & Middleware)
```

## API Endpoints

Here are the API endpoints used in the application:

- **GET /api/employees**: Retrieves all employee records.
- **GET /api/states**: Retrieves all states (for cascading dropdown).
- **GET /api/cities/{stateId}**: Retrieves cities based on selected state (for cascading dropdown).
- **POST /api/employees**: Adds a new employee record.
- **PUT /api/employees/{id}**: Updates an existing employee record by ID.
- **DELETE /api/employees/{id}**: Deletes an employee record by ID.

### Example jQuery AJAX Calls:

1. **Get Cities based on State Selection**:
   ```javascript
   $('#StateDropdown').change(function() {
       var stateId = $(this).val();
       $.ajax({
           url: '/api/cities/' + stateId,
           method: 'GET',
           success: function(data) {
               var cities = $('#CityDropdown');
               cities.empty();
               $.each(data, function(i, city) {
                   cities.append($('<option>', {
                       value: city.id,
                       text: city.name
                   }));
               });
           }
       });
   });
   ```

2. **Add Employee (AJAX POST)**:
   ```javascript
   $('#addEmployeeForm').submit(function(event) {
       event.preventDefault();
       $.ajax({
           url: '/api/employees',
           method: 'POST',
           data: $(this).serialize(),
           success: function(response) {
               alert('Employee added successfully');
               // Reload employee list or reset form
           }
       });
   });
   ```

### Notes:
- The **cascading dropdown** feature dynamically loads the **City** dropdown based on the **State** selection using AJAX.
- The project demonstrates common CRUD operations using jQuery and AJAX for smooth interactions without full page reloads.

Feel free to modify the code for your own purposes or integrate it with other applications! Let me know if you need more specific information added to the README or have further questions!
